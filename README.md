# OS-KEY ⌨️

Sick of not knowing whether to display ⌘ or CTRL? Me too. That's what OS-Key is gonna do.

Hey that rhymes!

## Scratchpad
Implement an api that returns an object with the OS, and then what the meta, ctrl, and shift keys are with symbols. Maybe like

```js
{
  os: 'mac',
  meta: '⌘',
  ctrl: '^',
  alt: '⌥'
}
```
